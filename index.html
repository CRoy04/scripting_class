					<h1>About</h1>
					<p> Conner Roy is attending the Multi-Media Program as a first-year student at Lethbridge College
						here in Southern Alberta. Roy is most fascinated with getting outside to shoot photography and
						video. He specializes in capturing landscapes, wildlife, and close-up photographs. Conner enjoys
						being out in nature because it allows him to be creative and utilize his surroundings to take
						better photos. He’s also interested in learning how to properly mix audio, being that he has a
						passion for music as well. His favourite kind of music is ‘90s to early 2000s rock, his
						favourite bands include: Tool, Pearl Jam, The Tea Party, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana. </p>

					<p>Mr. Roy was born in Lethbridge in 2000, and lived here until he was ten years old. In 2011 his
						family moved to the neighbouring town of Coaldale, where he’s lived since. Conner comes from a
						fortunate family of five being the oldest of three brothers and is still close with his mom and
						dad. Recently his family got a new dog named Rylee who is a two-year old black Bichon Shih Tzu.

					<h2>Interests</h2>
					<p> Having a competitive “teen-spirit”, Conner enjoys being outside and playing sports. In his
						senior year of high school back in 2018, he was the captain of both his hockey and baseball
						team. Since graduating he mostly focuses on his golf game, although it needs some work. Though
						he’s confident enough to think of himself as a natural born leader, being that he is the oldest
						of three brothers, was a captain of two senior teams and is a certified crew trainer. He also
						had a lead vacuum technician position at Hyperface Technologies for three years. Roy currently
						works at Strait-Way Equipment Rentals doing photography for advertising, and customer service.

					<h2>Inspirations</h2>
					<p>Inspired by his family and girlfriend, another inspiration in his life is Adam Jones, the
						creative mind behind the amazing guitar riffs, and intense music videos from Tool. Conner, who
						also plays guitar, is inspired by Jones through shared interests, his art, and through his
						bring-up. Jones played violin throughout high school and played stand-up bass for three years in
						an Orchestra after he graduated. Adam received a scholarship to go to college for music but
						chose to go to art school instead. He ended up doing special effects for movies such as Jurassic
						Park and Ghostbusters. Eventually falling back in love with music as a guitarist and joining
						Tool.
