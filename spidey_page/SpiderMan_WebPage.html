        <h2>When Did Spider-Man First Appear?</h2>
     
        <p>
            Arguably Marvel Comic’s most iconic character is Spider-Man. Famously co-created by Stan Lee
            (editor-in-Chief), Steve Ditko (co-writer and co-artist) and Jack Kirby (Artist). The first time Spider-man
            appeared was on August 10th, 1962, on the cover of the fifteenth issue of ‘Amazing Fantasy’. Originally the
            series was called ‘Amazing Adventures’ which then changed to ‘Amazing Adult Fantasy’ as they were trying to
            attract a more mature audience. 
            </p>

            <p>During the same year, Spider-man was released to the public on June 5th,
            which perhaps had such a big impact, it changed the reputation of the superhero/comic book industry forever
            as well as shaped the style of other Marvel characters for decades. More importantly, teaching us that
            superheroes can be ordinary people, with ordinary problems

        <h2>A New Look To Spidey</h2>
       
        <p>John Romita created a more 'bright and friendly' look to Spider-Man, which was opposite to Ditko’s famous
            dark, creepy-crawly style. Romita took Spider-Man out of the shadows and placed him in a new brave and
            bright world. On November 1st, 1966, ‘The Amazing Spider-Man’ issue forty-two was released, which is
            debatably “The finest single panel of comics work ever produced.” (David Barnett – 2023) On the final page
            in the issue, we are introduced to our hero’s love interest Mary Jane Watson, who is gleaming in a yellow
            blur of surprise with the famous line: “Face it, Tiger … you just hit the jackpot!”</p>

    <section id="Identity">

        <h2>The Man With the Mask</h2>

        <p>Every superhero has an identity. Spider-Man without the suit is Peter Parker, a fifteen year old American
            teenager born
            and raised in Queens, New York City. His parents were killed when he was young, and he has lived with his
            aunt
            and uncle since. Peter can be described as timid, shy, and nerdy, pretty much the opposite of his ‘super
            alter-ego’. Peter got his powers from a radio-active spider during a school field trip to a science
            facility,
            which bit him on the hand.

        </p>



        <br>
        <p> Shortly after discovering his powers his uncle Ben was shot in cold blood on the
            street. The last thing his uncle Ben told him before he passed was “With great power, comes great
            responsibility.” Because of this, Peter chooses to hide his identity to protect his loved ones.
            One of the biggest struggles Peter continuously has is balancing his Spider-Man life with his personal life.

    <section id="Skills">
        <h2>Knowledge and Skills</h2>
        <p>Besides his superpowers, Peter is a genius, being a brilliant chemist and scientist. Pete has advanced his
            powers through technology, creating web slingers which enhance his web shooting ability, as well as his
            electrified blasters which shoot large blasts of energy at enemies to stun them.

            Spider-Man stands out the most compared to other heroes because he is the first teenager to become a main
            character superhero. Before Spider-Man, teenagers were only sidekicks. Being that he is a teenager, with the
            fact that he has a secret identity, he was one of the few characters which had a normal life. Making Peter
            Parker one of the most relatable characters in the MCU.

    <section id="Friends and Foes">
        <h2> Enemies and Allies</h2>

        <img src="images/sinistersix.png" alt="The Sinister Six">
        <p> Spider-man has a vast number of enemies, basically anyone who has a criminal background in New York City
            wants to exterminate the Spider. Although there is a group of villains which are most famously known to be
            Spider-Mans arch enemies. This group goes by the name: The Sinister Six. The group originally includes
            Electro, Sandman, Dr. Octopus, Vulture, Mysterio, and Kraven the Hunter. Though fan favourite villains
            include Green Goblin, Venom, and my personal favourite: Carnage.
            Mind you, there are many different versions of Spider-Man, his background, and the Sinister Six members. I’m
            referring to the original comics which came out in the 60s.
        </p>


        <p> Peter has a very small circle of people who he’s close with, since he’s an only child and his parents and uncle Ben have all passed away. Aunt May is the only guardian Peter has, who he’s very close with.
            
            His best friend goes by the name of Harry Osborne, and his love interest is Mary Jane Watson, his neighbour. Spider-man isn’t the only one with enemies, throughout his high school and college life, Pete is bullied by another student named Flash Thompson.
